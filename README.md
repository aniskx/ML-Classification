[Logisitc Regerssion](https://github.com/aniskx/ML-Classification/blob/master/LogisticRegression.ipynb) : cleaning and preparing **' California house Prices'** data set and training with Logistic Regression Estimator for prices classification :

[HousingPriceRegression](https://github.com/aniskx/ML-Classification/blob/master/HousingPriceRegression.ipynb): from the previous notebook 'Logistic Regression' you can see some visualizion of our predicted target and a comparing graph of the predicted with actual values 

[ImageClassification](https://github.com/aniskx/ML-Classification/blob/master/ImageClassification.ipynb) : performing SGD Estimator to classify images of __'Fashion Minst'__  Dataset where i label each item with a given integer to specify its class 

[TitanicSurvivorModel](https://github.com/aniskx/ML-Classification/blob/master/TitanicSurvivorModel.ipynb) : preparing Titanic passengers Dataset and selecting features to feed Logistic Regression Model for classifying Survivors from non survivors

[multiple classification models for titanic](https://github.com/aniskx/ML-Classification/blob/master/multiple%20classification%20models%20for%20titanic%20.ipynb) : Illustrate implementation of several Classification Estimators and tuning hyperparameters to design best models
